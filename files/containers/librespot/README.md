# Firewall ports required

Outside the container you need to enable mdns service (UDP port 5353) on the firewall:
```
firewall-cmd --list-all
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=49999/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraServer --add-service=mdns 
```

# Sound packages to install on the container host
```
dnf install alsa-utils
```

# Getting the speaker working

```
[root@nuc images]# speaker-test -c 2 -D front --buffer 2000
```

Unmuted the master volume
```
amixer sset Master unmute
```
 
The sound works from the headphone jack ("front") once you do this

# Librespot identifying the sound device

Run the command
```
aplay -L
```

https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Devices

The command below definitely works, and the device name is from the output of the `aplay` command above
```
speaker-test -c 2 -D hdmi:CARD=PCH,DEV=0 --buffer 2000 
```

# How to run the container

Ephemeral
```
podman run -dt --rm --net host --device=/dev/snd --tz localhost/librespot
```
Pet
```
podman run -dt --net host --device=/dev/snd --tz=local localhost/librespot
```

# Scratchpad

We are using card 0, device 3, subdevice 0
Card 0
```
[root@nuc librespot]# cat /proc/asound/card0/pcm3p/sub0/hw_params 
```


## Multi stage builds
"You may also see Containerfiles with multistage builds where multiple FROM commands may be present. Multistage builds provide a means to help refine the runtime image as opposed to having an image which also contains all the necessary software to build. For instance you typically donâ€™t need maven to run a java based jar but do need it to build."

## Podman auto update

@Sreejith: yes, you need to setup a systemd.timer and unit for the container in order to use the podman auto update feature.

This is available in podman 3.0

Automatic container image updates
Podman 3.0 ships with podman-auto-update.service systemd unit.  Triggered daily, by default, checks registry and pulls updated container image, then restarts affected containers using systemd
